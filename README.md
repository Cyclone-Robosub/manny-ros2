# Systems-Architecture-2026
The new and improved codebase for 2026 (and hopefully beyond)!

This will contain the ROS nodes, topics, etc. developed by the Systems Architecture subteam of UC Davis Cyclone Robosub. It will also contain C code auto-generated by Matlab to be used in the robot control system.
